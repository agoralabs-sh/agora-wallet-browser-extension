### Airdrops Have Dropped!

On the 28th October 2024, all those that participated in the Testnet Phase 1 & 2 and Staking programs will have received their airdrops. For the Testnet program, 3.67% of the total token supply (367 million VOI) was allocated and 1.4% of the total token supply (140 million VOI) was allocated to the Staking program. Each program had an optional lock-up period, with the Testnet program having a higher lock-up period of upto 5 years, and, notably, 55% of the participants chose to lock-up for the full 5 years.

These effort-based airdrops are testament to Voi's commitment to being a truly community-driven blockchain.

You can check the state of your airdrop contracts using the beautifully crafted airdrop tool [https://staking.voi.network/](https://staking.voi.network/).
